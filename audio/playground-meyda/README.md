# playground-meyda

Uses the [Meyda](https://meyda.js.org/) library to [extract features](https://meyda.js.org/audio-features) from audio. By default, it extracts almost all the possible features.  Run `remote-meyda` in a window to produce data.

The playground is not meant for extending - just to give you a feel for the data. Use Meyda data the same way as the other samples demonstrate (eg beats, particles, thing, threshold).

Once you know what features you'll use, turn them off in the code for the remote to improve performance.
