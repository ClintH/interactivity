# look-at

Demonstrates using calculating and using the angle between two points. In this case, a set of triangles are positioned randomly and they rotate to follow the pointer. Rotation and positioning is accomplished via canvas transformations.

It also demonstrates how to draw based on data - in this case, a simple function that just knows how to draw a triangle By feeding it triangles from an array, more complicated results can be produced.

## Things to try

* Rather than responding to pointer movements, use a timer to move a point around: eg to random positions, or oscillating back and forth
* Change the drawing function so that things appear as something else
* Try adding data to each thing so each can have a random colour
