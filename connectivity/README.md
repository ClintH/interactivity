## Web Serial API

Note: these examples are only known to work in Chrome desktop

* web-serial-simple: send/receive text from a microcontroller and Chrome
* web-serial-json: send/receive data from a microcontroller and Chrome, packed as JSON
* web-serial-websocket: rebroadcasts all JSON received from a microcontroller over websockets. This allows, for example, data from your MCU to be consumed on a phone wirelessly.

## Websockets

* websocket-server: a simple Node.js websocket server
* websocket-skeleton: a starter for sending/receiving data via websockets.
* websocket-playground: test sending/receiving messages manually
