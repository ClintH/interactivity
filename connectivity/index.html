  <h1>web-serial</h1>
  <p>There are two examples using the Chrome Web Serial API to talk to a microcontroller. As always, check the README.md
    file within each folder. Serial.mjs is a helper class to simplify access to the API, and is used by
    both examples.</p>

  This demonstrates sending text back and forth in a simple way. Good enough for getting a sensor reading into the
  browser, or sending a command to alter the behaviour of a microcontroller.
  <h2><a href="web-serial">web-serial</a></h2>
  This example sends data back and forth as JSON objects. This allows for much richer data exchange, but is a little
  more complicated on the microcontroller side.
